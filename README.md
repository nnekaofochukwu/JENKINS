# JENKINS

Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins

Task Overview:
In this task, you will set up a Continuous Integration (CI) environment using Jenkins. This includes installing and configuring Jenkins, creating Jenkins jobs, and integrating Jenkins with a version control system. Additionally, you will create a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkinsfile, configure parameterized builds, build triggers, and set up automated testing and notifications. Finally, you will initialize a Git repository, commit your Jenkins configurations, and share the Git URL.

Instructions:

1. Set Up Jenkins

Install Jenkins:
Install Jenkins on your local machine or a cloud server (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
Document the installation process with screenshots and notes on any issues encountered and how they were resolved.
Initial Configuration:
Complete the initial setup wizard.
Install suggested plugins.
Create an admin user and configure basic security settings.
Document each step with screenshots and explanations.

2. Explore Jenkins Plugins
   
Explore and Install Essential Plugins:
Research and install at least 5 plugins that extend Jenkins functionality.
These should include:
Git Plugin
Pipeline Plugin
Email Extension Plugin
JUnit Plugin
Any other plugin of your choice
Document the purpose and usage of each plugin with screenshots.

3. Create and Configure Jenkins Jobs
Create a Freestyle Project:
Create a simple "Hello World" Jenkins freestyle job.
Configure the job to run a shell script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
Document the job creation process with screenshots and script details.

4. Parameterized Builds:
Modify the "Hello World" job to accept a parameter (e.g., a name) and print "Hello, [name]!".
Document the changes and provide screenshots showing the job running with different parameters.

5. Build Triggers:
Configure the job to run every 5 minutes using cron syntax.
Document the configuration with screenshots and explain how build triggers work.

6. Integrate Jenkins with Version Control Systems

Configure Jenkins with Git:
Set up a new Git repository on GitHub or any other Git hosting service.
Create a simple project (e.g., a Java application) in the repository.
Configure Jenkins to clone the repository and build the project.
Document the configuration process with screenshots and details of any issues encountered.

Jenkins Pipeline as Code:
Create a Jenkinsfile in your Git repository that defines the CI/CD pipeline.
The pipeline should include stages for building, testing, and deploying the application.
Configure Jenkins to use the Jenkinsfile and run the pipeline.
Document the Jenkinsfile content and pipeline execution with screenshots and explanations.

7. Putting It All Together

Create a Comprehensive CI Job:
Create a new Jenkins job that pulls code from your Git repository, runs tests, and deploys the application.
Use parameters to allow different deployment environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).
Set up email notifications to alert you of build successes or failures.
Document the job configuration and execution process with screenshots.

Automated Testing:
Integrate a testing framework (e.g., JUnit for Java projects) into your Jenkins pipeline.
Ensure that tests are run automatically as part of the build process and that results are reported.
Document the setup and results with screenshots and explanations.

8. Initialize Git and Push to Git
Initialize Git Repository:
Initialize a Git repository in your project directory using git init.
Add all Jenkins configuration files to the repository using git add ..
Commit the changes to the repository using git commit -m "Initial commit".
Create a remote repository on a Git hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
Add the remote repository URL using git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>.
Push the commits to the remote repository using git push -u origin master.
